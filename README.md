# ü¶∂ Clubfoot Shoe Fabrication ‚Äì Master's Academic Project

This repository contains the 3D models developed as part of my master's academic project: **Rapid Prototyping of Clubfoot Shoe Fabrication**. The goal of this project is to design and develop a customizable and low-cost orthopedic shoe using 3D printing for children suffering from clubfoot deformity.

## üß© Project Overview

Clubfoot (Congenital Talipes Equinovarus) is a birth defect where one or both feet are rotated inward and downward. Traditional solutions are either expensive or lack customization. This project focuses on:

- Using **3D scanning** to capture the foot geometry.
- Developing a **custom-fit shoe design** using Autodesk Meshmixer.
- Creating 3D printable models exported in `.stl` format.
- Fabricating prototypes using **FDM 3D printing** and testing for fit and comfort.
