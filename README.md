# 🧩 3D Modeling Projects

Welcome to my collection of 3D modeling projects! This repository showcases a range of mechanical designs, prototypes, and assembly models I created during academic coursework, internships, and personal exploration.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Software Used
- **Fusion 360** – Parametric design and simulation | advanced part & assembly modelling|
- **AutoCAD** – 2D to 3D conversion & drafting
- **ANSYS (basic simulations)** – Structural analysis
- **Meshmixer** – Mesh editing for 3D printing and point cloud manipulation
