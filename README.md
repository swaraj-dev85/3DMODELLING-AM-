# 🧩 3D Modeling Projects Repository

Welcome to my 3D Modeling repository! This collection showcases various 3D design projects I've worked on using tools like **Fusion 360**, **SolidWorks**, **Meshmixer**, and **AutoCAD**. Most of these designs are exported as `.STL` files and are optimized for 3D printing and prototyping.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Autodesk Fusion 360
- SolidWorks
- Meshmixer
- AutoCAD
- Cura / PrusaSlicer (for slicing)
- FDM 3D Printer

## 📂 Folder Structure



Each folder includes:
- STL file(s) ready for 3D printing
- Preview/screenshot of the model
- A short description of the design and its intended use

## 🧪 Use Cases
- Rapid prototyping for assistive devices
- Academic projects and mechanical assemblies
- Product development components
- Custom parts for robotics and automation

## 📦 Sample Projects
| Project Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Clubfoot Shoe** | Custom-fit orthopedic shoe for children with clubfoot, created using scanned foot data and 3D printed for prototyping. |
| **Prosthetic Hand** | A modular prosthetic hand designed for brain stroke survivors, optimized for comfort and printability. |


## 🖨️ 3D Printing Guidelines
- Layer height: 0.2mm
- Infill: 20% – 50%
- Material: PLA / ABS
- Support: As required (depending on overhangs)

## 🔧 How to Use
1. Download the desired `.step` file from the relevant folder.
2. Import the file into a slicer (e.g., Cura,Meshmixer,Netfabb).
3. Slice and export G-code based on your printer settings.
4. Print and test the model.
